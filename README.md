## Install

```sh
npm install send-action
```

## Minimal example

```js
var createStore = require('send-action')

var state = {
  items: []
}

var actions = {
  setItem: function (state, data) {
    state.items.push(data)
    return state
  }
}

function onChange (state, action) {
  // render app
  console.log(state, action)
}

var send = createStore({
  state: state,
  actions: actions,
  onChange: onChange
})

send('setItem', { title: 'hi' })
```

  - The early versions of choo used send-action! Now choo uses an event emitter approach for managing state which is very cool yet slightly more verbose than I prefer.
- [unistore](https://github.com/developit/unistore) - The latest version of send-action looks a little more like unistore than it did before. Some differences of send-action include:
  - the source is not transpiled before publish and sticks to es5
  - state is mutable, so there's no `setState` function
  - managing action functions is a little simpler
  - not returning state from an action avoids triggering the `onChange` handler
  - no way to subscribe listeners, only the `onChange` handler
  - if you use react, you'll have an easier time using unistore as it comes with a `Provider` component
